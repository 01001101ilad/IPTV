Free TV
=======

This is an M3U playlist for free TV channels around the World.

Philosophy
==========

The main goals for this playlist are listed below.

**Quality over quantity**

The less channels we support the better. The less countries we support the better.

- All channels should work well and be in HD.
- Only one URL per channel (no +1, no alternate feeds, no regional declinations)

**Only free channels**

If a channel is normally only available via commercial subscriptions it has nothing to do in this playlist. If on the other hand it is provided for free to everybody in a particular country, then it should be in this playlist.

- No paid channels
- Only channels which are officially provided for free (via DVB-S, DVB-T, analog, etc..)

**Only mainstream channels**

This is a playlist for everybody.

- No adult channels
- No channels dedicated to any particular religion
- No channels dedicated to any particular political party
- No channels made for a country and funded by a different country

Pull Requests
=============

**Adding a new Channel**

To add a new channel, make a Pull Request.

In your Pull Request you need to provide information to show that the channel is free.

**Removing a Channel**

To remove a channel, make a Pull Request.

In your Pull Request you need to provide information to show that the channel is only available via a private paid subscription.

Note: Public taxes (whether national or regional, whether called TV License or not) do not constitute a private paid subscription.
